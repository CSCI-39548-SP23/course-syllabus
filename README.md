# CSCI-395.48 - Practical Web Development <br/> Spring 2023, Hunter College
### Wednesday, 5:30pm - 8:00pm <br/> Rm TH405

---

## Course Description

This elective course is meant to introduce Computer Science students to modern day web development practices, languages, and frameworks that are in use in the industry today to do full stack web development. The course is mostly practical and hands-on to give the students as close to a real-world industry experience as possible. Students will spend the majority of the semester building web applications of varying degrees, from small assignments with initial boilerplate/template code, to building their own web app from scratch as part of a final project.

After the completion of this course, students are expected to have at least a basic understanding of how web application development works, and should be comfortable setting up a basic fullstack web-apps from scratch.

## Grading

40% - Assignments (4 x 10%) (Late submission penalties applied at 10% per week) <br/>
10% - Lab Report <br/>
10% - Participation/Presentation <br/>
40% - Final Project (30%) + Presentation (10%) <br/>

Just to be completely transparent about grades, you can calculate your final grade with the formula below:

```text
FinalGrade =
.10 * (assignment 1 grade) +
.10 * (assignment 2 grade) +
.10 * (assignment 3 grade) +
.10 * (assignment 4 grade) +
.10 * (lab report grade) +
.10 * (participation/presentation) +
.40 * (final project grade)
```

The formula should be pretty straightforward to understand. Your final letter grade is based on CUNY grading ranges as outlined [here](https://hunter.cuny.edu/students/registration/records-and-transcripts/grading-structure/).

## Course Materials/Readings
This is a zero-textbook cost course, and as such we don't have any required textbooks. Instead, we will mostly be going over API documentations, code samples, and other reading materials related to various frameworks and technologies that we will cover in this course. Below are links to some of the course materials we'll be using throuhgout the semester:

Books:

* https://eloquentjavascript.net/ <br/>
  * Amazon Link: https://www.amazon.com/Eloquent-JavaScript-3rd-Introduction-Programming/dp/1593279507
  * Useful book, content is also available online at the website above that the author made.


* JavaScript: The Good Parts
  * Amazon Link: https://a.co/d/83NUXkY
  * Really good light/intro reading on JavaScript


Documentations:
* MDN Docs: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/
  * Useful documentation from Mozilla Developer Network
  * Has information on HTML/CSS/JS syntax and methods.

* ReactJS Docs: https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html
  * Official documentation for ReactJS


* NodeJS Docs: https://nodejs.org/en/docs/
  * Official documentation for NodeJS
  * We will be using Node.js 17.x and +
  * Focusing mostly around the http module.


* ExpressJS Docs: https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html
  * Official documentation for ExpressJS
  * Minimal web framework build on top of NodeJS.

And additional documentations around frameworks that we'll take a look at.

In lieu of office hours, we will be leveraging Slack as a class-wide communication/collaboration platform. You can post questions/comments on anything regarding our course materials, assignment and projects. Please do be respectful of on another and avoid any (unintentional) plagiarism on the platform.

## Slack
We'll be using Slack as our primary communication platform. This is probably the best way to reach me, aside from my email/office hour meetings. I tend to check Slack throughout the day, especially if I'm at work, and will try and answer all questions/inquiries as soon as possible.

- Check our class Blackboard for the most up to date Slack invite link.
- Invites will not be emailed out individually so it's import that you join our classroom Slack yourself via the link provided on Blackboard.
- Reach out to me if you run into any issues with joining Slack!

### GitHub Classroom
We will be using GitHub classroom to complete our assignments. Each assignment link will be handed out via BlackBoard, which will give you access to your own personal assignment GitHub repository, where you will commit code/answers to your assignments.

As part of `assignment0` (not graded), you will be required to properly set up your GitHub account, and join our GitHub classroom.

## Participation/Presentation

Aside from your final presentation, 10% of your grade will be from a personal/individual presentation work. The web dev field is one that's always evolving, with new technologies/frameworks being adopted every day.

As part of your presentation, you can give a short ~5 min talk/report on what are some of the interesting changes that are happening in our field. This can be anything from a new framework that you picked up, a new JS library, or new technologies being developed that impacts the internet/web dev field.

We will devote the start of the class session (limited to 3 presentations max per class) to presentation, sign up sheet link will be posted on BlackBoard, and are on a first come first serve basis!

Just to give an outline on what's expected in your presentation, consider the points below:

- What is your presentation on? Is it a new framework/library that you found? Bugs that you encountered? Latest news in the web dev world?
- Why is this topic important to our field, and how does it impact our work?
- How does it address/cause certain issues that we find on the web?
